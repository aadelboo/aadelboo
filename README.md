# Hey, I'm Aadel 👋
I’m in the middle of a career pivot into tech. 🔀

🔐 Right now, I’m interning in Information Security, and I’ve found myself really drawn to the problem-solving side of it. I love the constant thinking—digging into systems, spotting weaknesses, and imagining better, safer ways for things to work. It’s not just technical; it’s analytical, creative, and strategic all at once. And that mix really suits me.

🎓 Alongside the internship, I’m studying for an Executive Master in Digital & IT Essentials at Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), where I’m diving into Python, AI, Cybersecurity, and Agile project management.

## A bit about my path so far:
I didn’t start in tech. I've built up my experience through different jobs and industries. My background includes:

- Many years in customer relationship management (banking & automotive)
- Digital transformation coaching
- Managing batch operations at a coding school

What ties it all together is this: I’ve always been drawn to systems, to people, and to the way things could work better. I’m naturally optimistic, always scanning for new ideas, new tools, and sometimes—I’ll admit it—I imagine myself as the guy who walks in with the solution.

## What I'm exploring:
I’m especially interested in roles that live at the intersection of people, systems, and tech, such as:

- Cybersecurity Analyst
- Business Analyst
- Data Analyst
- Information Security Analsyt

I think you've got that I'm really interested in jobs that combine business, tech, analysis, management and communication with different people.

I'm still exploring, learning fast, and keeping an open mind. If you're working on something or just figuring things out like I am, I'd love to connect.
